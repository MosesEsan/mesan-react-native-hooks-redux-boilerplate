### Introduction

When it comes to React Native, I always organize my projects by feature/module. 

Two of the main reasons I organize my projects this way are:
1. Makes my project clean and easy to navigate
2. Makes modules reusable

The link below gives a better understanding and explains the advantages of organizing your project in this manner.

### Folder Structure

In the project root, an app folder is created, this folder will hold all codes relating to the app. In this folder, we create multiple files and folders.

####Folders
Assets — This folder will hold all the assets, this includes fonts, images etc.

Components — This folder will contain components used across multiple modules, this folder will not contain any component that is only used by a specific module.

Modules — This folder will contain all the modules.

Redux — This folder will contain the rootReducer and store files for redux.
